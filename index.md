Hi Nitish here !! 

Recently I cracked the IBM Cloud Advocate V1 certification exam. I am going to share my experience with you here..

I found the content of this exam to be very beneficial for anyone who would like to kick start their cloud journey with IBM Cloud.

### Study Plan : 

This is the same study plan I used to pass IBM Advocate v1 exam:

                 ### 1. 3 day for learning from IBM Cloud learning path.
                 ### 2. 1 day for exam preparation
                  
One day means 6–8 hours of work. So it might take around a weeks to study 2–3 hours per day after work.
I used IBM Cloud learning path videos, However, the material is great quality but its quite lengthy.

This learning path took me 9–10 hours including taking notes and research on random technical words.
